# vim-as-a-python-ide

Vim as a Python IDE

1) Support Python 2 and Python 3 base on your vim compile options ( dynamic may not supported, not tested).

2) Support Python syntax check, use flake8 as a checker.

3) Support Python auto completion, use jedi to take care of it.

4) Support virtualenv, just put venv.py in your ~/.vim directory.

5) Support JavaScipt syntax check, use jslint as a checker.

6) And a lot of vim plugins I often use :).
